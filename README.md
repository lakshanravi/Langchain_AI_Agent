AI Agent with Gemini (Search + Weather Tools)

AI Agent is a tool-enabled intelligent assistant built using Google Gemini and LangChain.
This project demonstrates how to combine a large language model with external tools such as web search and weather APIs to build an agent capable of retrieving real-time information and reasoning over it.


Project Overview

The AI agent is designed to:

Answer general knowledge questions
Perform live web searches
Retrieve real-time weather information
Combine tool outputs with LLM reasoning
Demonstrate agent-based AI architecture

The agent dynamically decides when to use external tools and when to generate responses directly.
